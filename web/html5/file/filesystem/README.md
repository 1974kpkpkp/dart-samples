This sample ports the example used in the
[Exploring the FileSystem APIs](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/)
HTML5Rocks example by Eric Bidelman.

With the FileSystem API, a web app can create, read, navigate, and write to a
sandboxed section of the user's local file system.

View the
[source](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-samples/tree/master/web/html5/file/filesystem)
for this example.

Use the  example to list the files and folders in the local file system. You
can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking on `index.html`.
Or, you can try this
[live demo](http://www.dartlang.org/samples/filesystem/example/index.html).

Please report any [bugs or feature requests](http://dartbug.com/new).
