A simple example showing use of the Notifications API. To find out more about
this API, read the
[Using the Notifications
API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick) article by
Ernest Delgado, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

The Notifications API allows you to display notifications to the user for
given events, both passively (new emails, tweets, or calendar events) and on
user interactions.

You can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking `index.html`.
Or, you can try this
[live demo](http://www.dartlang.org/samples/notifications/).

When you click the say-hello button  and grant permission to show
notifications, you should see a notification after a short delay.
The notification displays even if you switch to a different tab.

Please report any [bugs or feature requests](http://dartbug.com/new).
